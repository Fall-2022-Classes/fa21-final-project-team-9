### Introduction
We made a zombie shooter last stand top down cool griddy filled game. (Change this lol)

<br>  

### Audio Cores
The audio cores used in the project are based on the ones devloped by (INSERT NAME) Chu and were provided by the textbook (INSERT THE NAME KYLER) but have been modifed to suit the needs of the project. Orignally the cores were set to produce sounds based on a sine wave. This has been altered to support four possible signals, a sine wave, a sawtooth wave, a random (noise) wave, and a square wave. The DFFS audio core outputs one of these signals to the ADSR core and a register control which signal is to be used. The user can write to this register to change which audio source they wish to use.
